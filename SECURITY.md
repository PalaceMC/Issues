## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take vulnerabilities seriously, and offer compensation to those who responsibly report them.

For any vulnerabilities, such as gamebreaking bugs, I ask that you directly DM one of the online Administrators through Discord. Please provide a description of the problem and your Minecraft username (if the problem is in-game).

Failing to report vulnerabilities responsibly will likely result in a ban.

If you discovered a problem with the help of others, please provide their usernames so we do not unintentionally punish them.
